Library usage examples
======================

Those examples should work, but they are mostly just a reference on how to
use different parts of the library.

Makefiles in the directories should work, but may be outdated. Please
use `Makefile.example` for new projects.

Some more examples can be found in repo `MightyPork/avr-projects`
